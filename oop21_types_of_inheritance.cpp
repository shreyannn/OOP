/*
  21a)
  There are 4 types of inheritance which can be seen in the picture below in next program -:

  where, A is base/parent class
         B is derived/child class    (C,D as well)




  22b)
  we can create our own custom hybrid class as well  but we might ceratin problems like ambiguity (the quality of being open to more than one interpretation;)
  in 22b,
  we mixed SIMPLE and MULTIPLE types of inheritance
  where we face problems like ambiguity of the function when we call it. it arrives from multiple path instead of one.
         it can solve by writing virtual while inheriting class.
