* Advantages to using the C++ I/O stream classes

-> Although input and output are implemented with streams for both C and C++, 
   the C++ I/O stream classes provide the same facilities for input and output as C stdio.h.

   The I/O stream classes in the Standard C++ Library have the following advantages:

i)  The input (>>) operator and output (<<) operator are typesafe. These operators are easier to use than scanf() and printf().
ii) You can overload the input and output operators to define input and output for your own types and classes.
     This makes input and output across types, including your own, uniform.
