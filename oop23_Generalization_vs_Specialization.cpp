/*
   shape -----> rectangle, circle , quadrilateral          (generalization)
   here, shape is logical, not physical.
   buttom-up approach
   the purpose of generalization is to group them together to obtain POLYMORPHISM ( looks same (same name) but different from inside )


   rectangle ----> cuboid                                 (specialization)
   here, rectangle is physical.
   top -down approach
   the purpose of specialization is to INHERITANCE.
